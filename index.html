            My name is Dave Derosiers, I was born and raised in Aruba. I came to
            the Netherlands to further my studies in Information Communication
            and Technology (ICT). Why? because I think its very cool &
            interesting. I'm currently studying at Fontys University of Applied
            Sciences (HBO). I have a passion for technology and a strong drive
            to succeed and make a positive impact in the world with my studies
            and future career.

            Why I chose ICT infrastructure?
          </h2>
          <p>
            ICT infrastructure is critical for the functioning and delivery of
            various ICT services such as internet connectivity, e-commerce,
            e-government, and digital communication. I like to build networks
            and experiment with Linux and Windows. I also plan on doing
            Cyber-security in the future. So far during my studies at Fontys I
            build relationships with future Software engineers, Ux/Ui designers,
            Cloud engineers and many more.

          <h2 class="line2 anim-typewriter2">Personal Goals</h2>
          <p>
            With a strong interest in cyber security, I am determined to
            specialize in this field and make a career out of it. I am committed
            to acquiring the skills and knowledge necessary to secure and
            protect valuable information in the digital age & also to defend
            myself in the digital world.
